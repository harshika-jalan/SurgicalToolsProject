# Surgical Tool Checker
An article in the Outpatient Surgery magazine has written that an instrument processing department in the US has to process 900 trays of instrument per day. Due to this high volume of surgical tools, hospitals are facing challenges in reducing the number of missing tools in their inventory as well as incomplete surgical sets in operation theatre. Traditionally, the hospital staff at the instrument checking department check each tool manually and tally it with the reference sheet. This process is time consuming, stressful and prone to errors as it is difficult for a humanâ€™s naked eye to notice the similarities between 2 different tools. Hence, this project aims to develop an intelligent system to identify the surgical tools placed on the platform, tally them with the reference toolset and warn the user if any missing or wrong tools are placed on the platform.
